			"description": "In school, children often struggle with geometry. As a concerned mother, I decided to help my children learn geometry better by playing games with them. Eventually, my husband made them a slide made out of hexagons, and we would test them on how to find the interior angles, the different sides if they were chopped up into different shapes, etc. When our children began to tackle their assignments with more enthusiasm, we decided that this could help other children. Thanks to Come Together, and our great community, we were able to crowd-source enough team mates and funds so that a playground based around a geometry theme could be built on an abandoned lot next to a neighbor's home. Our family and everyone else's are just amazed at how coming together to help our children has enriched their lives greatly.",

			"description": "Years ago, I traveled to China and studied Zen Buddhism in a small temple. The experience taught me so much that when I decided to come back to the States, I vowed to spread the teachings I had been enlightened by. As a small way of doing so, I went on Come Together and asked my neighbors to help me convert my backyard into a full Zen garden, \"Zensation\". Once interested members joined my team, we came up with a great plan and managed to accrue enough money to execute construction. Within a few months, Zensation was completed and was opened to the community. Everyone is now much more healthy and joyful thanks to the capabilities of Come Together!",

When the entire neighborhood started keeping an eye out for him, one of our family's friends said, \"You know, if only we could have somehow looked for Maximus before you guys even noticed he was gone.\" That's when our family rallied the neighbors and came up with Lost Pet Watch, a system where you and your neighbors can keep track of your pets' locations. If at any time our pets' whereabouts were unknown or off the radar, everyone with the app would be alerted and on the search. Thanks to Come Together, Lost Pet Watch has been able to save countless pets from being lost.",

However, when he found that more instruments and a bigger practice space were necessary, Trevor utilized Come Together and managed to gain the funds needed from the local community, and even beyond.

			"answer": "Our focus is creating an environment that cultivates community involvement and empowerment in local projects. Our inspiration(s) were websites such as, Point, GoFundMe, Meetup, Kickstarter and Indigogo. We were amazed with the potential of crowdsourcing and how everyday people could create a product/service/mortgage that could be backed by the public and not a bank or an individual investor. We wanted to bring this idea into the world of community projects, where crowdsourcing is already the major force, but in an easier and more streamlined way that would enable more people to join and create projects."
